# An animal crossing villager compatibility checker

Look https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Compatibility for more information about villager compatibility. This script just automated the procedure in that wiki. Note this methodology is for New Leaf. I don't know how New Horizon does this yet. Hopefully there isn't too much change.

The villager DB is based on https://github.com/Maxzilla60/AC-Lister/blob/2.0/src/shared/repository/villagers.json, with the new ACNH villagers data added (Audie, Judy, Dom, Cyd, Raymond, Sherb, Cyd, Megan).

Usage: 

`python3 ./main.py <Villager 1 ID>, <Villager 2 ID>, ...<Villager n ID>`

An example:
